A web-based “String Tree” that takes a user’s input (a string of numbers/characters) and visualizes it as a binary tree. Each character becomes a circle (node) placed using absolute positioning. The layout updates dynamically as you type or remove characters. The page also includes a footer with a styled background, showcasing DOM manipulation and simple tree visualization in JavaScript.
